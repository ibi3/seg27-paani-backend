go through files in this order:
	server.js
	routes/userRoute.js
	controllers/userController.js
	models/userModel.js

gist of it is:
	define routes in a file in routes/
	define what happens when that route is visited in a file in controllers/.
	define the Model (class) and SQL queries pertaining to that model in a file in models/
	DONT FORGET TO IMPORT AND app.add() THE ROUTES IN SERVER.JS
